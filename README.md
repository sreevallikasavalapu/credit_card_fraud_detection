CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION:

Credit card fraud detection is an essential process in the financial industry aimed at identifying and preventing unauthorized transactions. With the rapid growth of online commerce and digital payments, the incidence of fraud has significantly increased, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This field leverages a variety of techniques, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, to analyze transaction patterns and identify anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity. Key steps in the detection process include data collection and preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development. Advanced algorithms, such as neural networks, decision trees, and ensemble methods, are commonly employed to enhance detection accuracy.
